_**Calculator**_:
A simple single-operation calculator that supports the following functionalities:
Mathematical Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulo (remainder of a division)

_Additional Features_:
Clear: Resets the calculator input.
Backspace: Erases the last entered number or operation.
+/-: Toggles the sign of a number (positive to negative, and vice versa).
.: Enters the decimal point for floating-point numbers.
=: Computes and displays the result of the arithmetic operation.

_**Wordle**_:
A C++ implementation of the popular word puzzle game "Wordle," based on the official New York Times version. The game pulls words from the official NYT Wordle word list, allowing users to guess five-letter words within a limited number of attempts. The project demonstrates key programming concepts such as:

-_Data Structures_: Utilizes arrays and strings to store and manage word lists efficiently.

-_Reading and Handling Data_: Incorporates file handling to load the official word list for the game.

-_Memory Optimization_: Ensures efficient memory usage when processing large datasets, such as the word list.

-_Input Handling_: Validates user input, ensuring correct formatting and providing appropriate feedback for each guess.
